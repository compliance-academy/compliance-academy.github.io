Welcome to my first blog.

The definition of a blog is a diary/journal.

That being said, today's diary entry reads:

TODAY'S VENT
"Today yet another delegate who had registered for a training course is ignoring my emails and calls.  Today is the due date for payment.
Is it too difficult to ask for a quick email cancelling or deferring the booking?  The delegates must understand that venues and catering have to be booked, presenters confirmed, material printed and exams scheduled in advance."

These all incur costs that cannot be recouped if you don't bother to cancel or pay your invoice in time. 
I know that I am not the only one faced with this challenge.  A little bit of consideration and courtesy please.

Still on the topic of human behaviour, let's discuss ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE.

In my previous life, I was astounded to hear compliance officers say that they did not see the link between ethics and compliance.  Although, ironically, I did hear a senior compliance officer turned consultant describe the link as compliance floating on a sea of ethics
