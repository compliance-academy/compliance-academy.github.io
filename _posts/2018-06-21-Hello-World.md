Welcome to my first blog.

The definition of a blog is that it is a diary/journal.
That being said, if I did keep a diary it would read:

TODAY'S VENT
"Today yet another delegate who had registered for a training course is ignoring my emails and calls.  Today is the due date for payment." Is it too difficult to ask for a quick email cancelling the booking?  Please understand that venues and catering have to be booked, presenters confirmed, material printed and exams scheduled in advance and which all incur costs that cannot be recouped if you don't bother to cancel or pay your invoice in time. 

I know that I am not the only one faced with this challenge.  A little bit of consideration and courtesy please.
